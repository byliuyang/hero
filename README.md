# Hero
Cross-framework UI Component Framework in TypeScript

## Get Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js v8.9.4
- yarn v1.12.3

### Installing Dependencies
```
yarn
```

## Development

### Compiling project

```
yarn watch
```

You should see the following files in `dist`:

- index.html
- ui.js

To view the example app, open `index.html` in the web browswer.

The page will automatically reload on code change through the magic provided by `HotReload` Webpack plugin.

### Using components in exisiting app
You only need to include the generated `ui.js` file in the HTML to integrate `hero` UI components in your existing project.

## Testing

```
yarn test
```
